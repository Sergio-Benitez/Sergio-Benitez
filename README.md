## 📂 Completed Projects  

### 🔹 **[Minishell](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/Minishell)**  
💻 A miniature shell that replicates basic features of bash. It supports command parsing, execution, environment variables, redirections (>, <, >>), pipelines (|), and built-in commands like cd, echo, pwd, export, and exit. This project strengthens understanding of process management, file descriptors, and terminal behavior.

### 🔹 **[Philosophers](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/philo)**  
🍽️ A concurrency problem where multiple philosophers must alternate between eating and thinking without causing deadlocks or starvation, using **threads and mutexes**.  

### 🔹 **[Push_swap](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/Push_Swap)**  
♟️ An algorithmic challenge where a set of numbers must be sorted using only two stacks and a limited set of operations, requiring an optimized sorting strategy.  

### 🔹 **[Pipex](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/Pipex)**  
🔀 A project focused on process creation and inter-process communication using **pipes** (`|`). It mimics the behavior of shell piping by executing two commands and redirecting their output efficiently.  

### 🔹 **[So_Long](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/So_Long)**  
🎮 A **2D game** developed using the **MiniLibX** graphics library. The player must navigate through a map, collecting items and reaching an exit while avoiding obstacles. This project introduces **event handling, textures, and game logic**.

### 🔹 **[Get Next Line](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/GetNextLine)**  
📜 A function that reads a file **line by line**, handling memory allocation efficiently and working with any file descriptor.  

### 🔹 **[Ft_printf](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/Printf)**  
🖨️ A recreation of the `printf()` function in C, supporting various format specifiers (`%d`, `%s`, `%x`, etc.), precision handling, and buffer management.  

### 🔹 **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/Born2beroot)**  
🖥️ A system administration project that involves setting up a virtual machine, configuring user privileges, and implementing security measures.  

### 🔹 **[Libft](https://github.com/Sergio-Benitez/42/tree/master/Cursus/Libft)**  
📝 A custom implementation of essential C library functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `malloc`, etc.), creating a personal library to be reused in future projects.
